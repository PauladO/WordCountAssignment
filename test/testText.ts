export const testText1 = 'I\'m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn\'t alive to see this day. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. You, a bobsleder!? That I\'d like to see! Professor, make a woman out of me. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Negative, bossy meat creature! Morbo can\'t understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that\'s shaped like a man wearing a hat. Bender?! You stole the atom. It doesn\'t look so shiny to me. Professor, make a woman out of me. And remember, don\'t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don\'t not do it! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Do a flip! I haven\'t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Who are you, my warranty?! You are the last hope of the universe. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Just once I\'d like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn\'t bound and gagged. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn\'t you just get me the death penalty? Good news, everyone! There\'s a report on TV with some very bad news! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Are you crazy? I can\'t swallow that. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you\'d cease to exist! Yeah, and if you were the pope they\'d be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." OK, if everyone\'s finished being stupid. How much did you make me? And yet you haven\'t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Can I use the gun? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Are you crazy? I can\'t swallow that. Why would I want to know that? Hi, I\'m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Leela\'s gonna kill me. It\'s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? This opera\'s as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can\'t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! You\'re going back for the Countess, aren\'t you? I\'m a thing. Is that a cooking show? Yes! In your face, Gandhi! It\'s okay, Bender. I like cooking too. There\'s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! And yet you haven\'t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I\'ll rest easier not knowing where they are. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Hey, whatcha watching? No, she\'ll probably make me do it. Belligerent and numerous. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! They\'re like sex, except I\'m having them! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You don\'t know how to do any of those. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Now Fry, it\'s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Are you crazy? I can\'t swallow that. I wish! It\'s a nickel. Noooooo! I could if you hadn\'t turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Why would I want to know that? You wouldn\'t. Ask anyway! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won\'t be sure you\'ve done anything at all. Also Zoidberg. I can explain. It\'s very valuable. We\'ll need to have a look inside you with this camera. I found what I need. And it\'s not friends, it\'s things. Moving along… When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!';

export const testText2 = 'You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You hit me with a cricket bat. It\'s art! A statement on modern society, \'Oh Ain\'t Modern Society Awful?\'! No… It\'s a thing; it\'s like a plan, but with more greatness.  Annihilate? No. No violence. I won\'t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I\'m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn\'t you? All I\'ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?  No, I\'ll fix it. I\'m good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I\'m the Doctor. Don\'t call me the Rotmeister. I hate yogurt. It\'s just stuff with bits in. You know when grown-ups tell you \'everything\'s going to be fine\' and you think they\'re probably lying to make you feel better?  No, I\'ll fix it. I\'m good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I\'m the Doctor. Don\'t call me the Rotmeister. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there\'s an escaped fish. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.  I\'m the Doctor, I\'m worse than everyone\'s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I\'m introducing myself. I\'m the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don\'t know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don\'t know why';
